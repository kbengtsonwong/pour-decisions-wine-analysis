Description:

The objective of this project is to predict the wine ratings given the attributes of a given wine and a review from an expert.

The pipeline notebook accesses the data in the wine_reviews and processes it for analysis. We are using text processing and vadersentiment to extract features and additional scores to help predict the rating.

We are using a combination of Random Forest Regressor, Ada Boost Regressor, Lasso Linear Regression, Extra Trees Regression, but ultimately the Extra Trees Regression was the best.



Dependencies:

Used base environment for ml_lab class with rfpimp and vadersentiment pip installed. Environment stored as pourdecenv.yml
